<h1>Spinach Ricotta Ravioli  </h1>


<p><strong><p style= font-size:36px><p style=color:#4B6043>
Ingredients:
<br>
<br>2 cups DeLallo Whole-Milk Ricotta
<br>2 cups fresh spinach, finely chopped
<br>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
<br>1 egg
<br>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
<br>A pinch freshly grated nutmeg
<br>Salt and pepper
<br>Homemade Pasta Dough

<br>
<br>To create the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl using only half of the Parmigiano.
<br>
<br>
On a floured surface, divide your dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the rest of the dough covered in a bowl under a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying out.
<br>
<br>
Roll out dough thinly into a long rectangular shape. Using a dough-cutter wheel, cut 2 long rectangular strips of equal size, about 3 inches wide.
<br>
<br>Working quickly, spoon a rounded teaspoon onto the dough. Do this about 2 inches apart along the pasta sheet.
<br>
<br>Place the other dough rectangle on top, lining up the edges as best as you can. Press lightly along the edges.
<br>
<br>
Using the wheel cutter, first trim off the 4 sides of the rectangle. Next, cut out each square to form ravioli. 
<br>
<br>Seal each with your fingers. To prevent sticking, place finished pasta on a well floured tray.
<br>
<br>
Continue this process, preparing as many ravioli as you can, balancing the amount of filling with the remaining dough.
<br>
<br>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the ravioli one by one. Stirring them gently to prevent sticking, cook for about 8 minutes. 
<br>
<br>Drain and add hot ravioli to a saucepan with DeLallo Pomodoro Fresco Marinara Sauce.
